Photo collage with tiles sorted by their color models
---------------

This project converts a collection of images in a directory into a collage where the tile images are sorted by their color models. The tile images in an output collage are arranged in a grid as close to the square as possible, in order left to right, top to bottom. The supported color models are RGB, YIQ, HLS, HSV.

Example invocation:
```
make collage-jpg DIR_IMG=/home/user1/Photos/my-holidays-in-exotic-place/
```

Example output collages:
